<h2 class="pageTitle">Toolkit</h2>

<p>After the first year of the Art Information Commons planning period (October 2018-September 2019), we reflected upon major activities to date and lessons learned to develop a Toolkit for institutions of any size tackling a holistic art information management initiative.</p><br>

<button class="accordion">Save plenty of time for planning!</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Thoughtful planning for large endeavors takes a while, often longer than you anticipate.</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Identify your project team.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
A project team could be people specifically hired for the initiative and/or existing staff. If your project team includes existing staff, it is important to make space in their schedules and workload so that they can dedicate enough time, effort, and thought-space for the project. <br><br>
Make sure to identify a project manager, or similar role, because coordination is a major part of completing a successful initiative.

</p>
</div>  
  
<button class="accordion">Clarify roles, tools, management, communications and decision-making strategies.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>Once the team is identified, clearly establish roles and responsibilities for each team member.<br><br>
Formalize meeting structure and frequency, which should include <a href="http://www.managementcenter.org/resources/check-meetings-sample-agenda/">agendas</a>, timeboxing each item, and document versioning; identify <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DpxBRSE2FwxNazRMUOozf-MVRChCqCr7m7p1Fl_gx4U/edit#slide=id.g6ee97e4a4_026"> how decisions are made</a> and the approval process; and create a flow of communications within the team.<br><br>
Sample tools: We use Monday.com for task management, Outlook for email and scheduling, and Google Drive for sharing project documents. Additionally, we use MOCHA (Manager, Owner, Consulted, Helper, Advisor) as a roles and responsibilities framework as taught by the <a href="http://www.managementcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MOCHA-for-managers.pdf">Management Center</a>. The <a href="https://www.teamgantt.com/blog/raci-chart-definition-tips-and-example">RACI</a> model is another similar roles and responsibilities framework.<br><br>
By clarifying roles and establishing the needed structure, your team will be able to work more efficiently and effectively.

<button class="accordion">Get buy-in from leadership and key stakeholders.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>It is critical to have buy-in from your institution’s leadership and key stakeholders. Their active support will highlight the importance of your initiative and help bolster engagement across the organization..<br><br>
We identified key internal stakeholders and created an internal Steering Committee made up of staff from across the institution from whom we gain regular feedback as we progress with the initiative.
  
</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Discuss, discuss, discuss.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>Create a communications and change management strategy that facilitates active engagement and open dialog within and across the institution. Here is a lightweight <a href="/uploads/Art Information Commons Comunications Plan Template.pdf">communications plan template</a> we designed for our use.<br><br>
Try to decide what information you need to gather from staff. Then shape standard questions to gain the types of information you are seeking.<br><br>
Discussions should be focused on leveraging the work already being done and to gather feedback from across the institution.We broke our discussions into <a href="/uploads/CURRENT_Art Information Commons Roadshow Deck July 2019.pdf">roadshows</a> (departmental/team/group meetings), Coffee with the Commons (quarterly open forums for all staff), and individual meetings with staff.<br><br>
Establish a place for feedback for those who do not attend these meetings, and a process for recording and transcribing your discussions for future analysis. We used Google Forms, and shared this via email and our staff intranet.<br><br>
These discussions will not only inform the work of the initiative, but will also build institutional trust, which, in turn, creates an environment that supports change.

</p>
</div>

  <button class="accordion">Get an outside perspective.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>We established an external advisory board to guide and provide informed feedback on the initiative. No matter how you shape your approach, external advisors provide valuable perspective and grounding.  <br><br>
We identified key leaders in the digital humanities and cultural heritage fields to be on our Advisory Board. Some advisors we knew from past projects and others we did not know. We reached out to them via email, explained our project, and formally invited them to be a part of our Advisory Board. We established a schedule with annual in-person meetings and quarterly update calls. They also participate in onsite programming such as panels and/or lectures. <br><br>
Gather and share information about potentially related tools, projects, and resources in the field. We did this through an environmental scan. This provides insights about existing tools, lessons learned from similar efforts, and perspectives from others working to solve related problems. Here is our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nNUfM4b5VUVshjE42zWVCCKSfHOO8-YIz3uptaXXYo/edit#gid=259792391">Environmental Scan</a>--feel free to add to and build from it.

</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Analyze</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Establish a process for how you want to collect the feedback and information you are gathering from your colleagues. The rich discussions you are having will generate a great deal of valuable qualitative data to inform the work to come.  <br><br>
We captured comments and feedback in a spreadsheet. For each discrete comment, we documented all pertinent details, including the type of meeting in which it was said, the date of that meeting, and the name and department of the individual who made the comment. We then mapped each comment to a specific column, analyzed the data in each column, and <a href="/uploads/Art Information Commons Feedback Challenge Tagging Summary.pdf">tagged the comments</a> based on themes and patterns that were emerging from the data. This data will help inform your vision, scope, and roadmap for continued exploration. 

</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Create a Vision, Scope, and Roadmap.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Once you’ve had conversations with as many stakeholders as possible and gathered substantial, informative feedback, create a vision and scope to focus your roadmap for your next planning phase. Base the documents on your overarching objectives for the initiative and all that you have learned so far. Be sure to get feedback on your draft documents from your key advisors. In our case, the internal Steering Committee, external Advisory Board, and Director provided guidance and input.<br><br>
A vision should be a high level goal for the overall initiative, beyond the planning phase. A scope should indicate what is within the purview of the initiative now, what is out of scope at this moment with potential to include later, and what is out of scope that will never be a part of the initiative. A roadmap is an actionable plan for the next year or selected time period of your planning phase. It should include why you are conducting certain projects, who will be involved and their level of engagement, and what steps you will take to complete each project. Know that your Roadmap will evolve with the initiative.<br><br>
The Vision, Scope, and Roadmap will help your team remain on track and work more efficiently. In addition, it can be used as a communications resource when asked what the initiative is tackling and why.

</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Moving Forward</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Decide on a small number of test cases or prototypes with which to start. <br><br> 
We took a programmatic approach, as we had several major initiatives underway that our work could tie into. What strategic initiatives is your institution developing that your work can support and help sustain? What projects might be useful test-beds to explore your initiative’s goals? Develop meaningful criteria to help select your test cases and prototypes.<br><br>
Use the rest of the planning period to test, iterate, and refine.
