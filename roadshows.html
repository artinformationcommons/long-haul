<h2 class="pageTitle">Roadshows</h2>

<p>
<b>February - July 2019</b><br>
Introductory presentations and discussions or roadshows were held with key departments involved in the creation, research, synthesis, and general use of the museum's art information. We have been capturing and organizing insights, challenges, perspectives, and lessons learned, arising throughout discussions across the institution. Given the collaborative nature of this initiative, we want to be sure to track and incorporate what we are hearing, ensuring that nothing is lost along the way. All of the gathered and synthesized information will help us work towards testing possible solutions and reworking our trajectory for the initiative. You may view the current roadshow presentation <b><a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/uploads/CURRENT_Art%20Information%20Commons%20Roadshow%20Deck%20July%202019.pdf">here</a></b> and the initial analysis of such feedback <b><a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/uploads/Art%20Information%20Commons%20Feedback%20Challenge%20Tagging%20Summary.pdf">here</a></b>.
