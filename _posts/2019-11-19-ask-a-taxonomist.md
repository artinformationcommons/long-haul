### Ask a Taxonomist...Between Two Ferns

Tuesday, November 19<br>
3:00–4:00 p.m.<br>
Perelman Building<br>
@LandAatPMA

A riff on comedian Zach Galifinakis’ Funny or Die series Between Two Ferns and the social media hashtag #askacurator, we conducted an interview with Bree Midavaine (Taxonomist) who works with the museum’s Library and Archives on the AIC initiative. 

Juliet Vinegra (AIC Project Manager) posed questions, sent by staff and external colleagues, asking Bree about what, exactly, a taxonomist does, her role in the Art Information Commons initiative, and general knowledge management.
